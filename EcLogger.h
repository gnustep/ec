/** Instances of the EcLogger class are used to handle various types of
 * logging.<br />
 * The default implementation supports writing to local files and sending
 * logs to a remote process (by default, the Command server).<br />
 * Configuration options control the amount of data buffered in memory
 * before logs are flushed, and the amount of time for which data may
 * be buffered in memory before being flushed.<br />
 * Configuration options are ???Server (to specify the name of the
 * server to log to if not Command) and ???Flush (to specify when to
 * flush the in-memory buffer), where ??? is the type of logging being
 * done by a logger object.<br />
 * When there is no type-specific flush configuration, the DefaultFlush
 * configuration key will be used.<br />
 * The flush configuration value must be a floating point number of
 * seconds after which to flush, optionally folowed by a colon and an
 * integer number of kilobytes of data allowed before the buffer is
 * flushed.

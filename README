Getting started
===============

1. Make sure you have GNUstep installed

2. Type 'make' ... to build the code and the documentation

3. Read the documentation (point your web browser at the ECCL subdirectory)

4. (optional) Customise (see local.make) and do 'make clean'.

5. Install it (type 'make install') and try it out.

Key points ...

1. You may want to use 'defaults write NSGlobalDomain EcvEffectiveUser xxx'
where 'xxx' is your username, to tell the system it should be running as you.

2. Debug files are written in ~xxx/Logs ... look there to diagnose problems.

3. Configuration is in ~xxx/Data.  Specifically, you need to configure
~xxx/Data/Command/Control.plist, ~xxx/Data/Command/Operators.plist, and
~xxx/Data/Command/AlertConfig.plist before the Control server will start.
There are examples in thee same directory as this README
